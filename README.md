# 4x4

A native desktop client for a remote [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) daemon, written in Rust.

## Status

Early development — stage 0 (project foundation). Nothing is usable yet.

## What it will do

- Connect to a Transmission daemon by host, port and RPC path, show the connection state, and
  reconnect automatically. While offline, the last data stays visible and is marked as stale.
- Show the state of every torrent at a glance: a distinct color and icon for downloading, seeding,
  paused, queued, checking and error, with a progress bar in every row.
- Highlight what is active and dim what is idle.
- Sort by clicking a column header; show, hide, reorder and resize columns.
- Filter by state from a sidebar with live counts, and search by name.
- Show torrent details: general information, and a file tree with per-file progress, Low / Normal /
  High priority and the option to skip individual files.
- Add torrents from `.torrent` files (file dialog or drag and drop) and magnet links, choosing the
  destination folder and, for `.torrent` files, which files to download.
- Act as the system handler for `.torrent` files and `magnet:` links.
- Start, pause, start now, verify and reannounce one or several torrents; copy the magnet link or
  hash; use a context menu and keyboard shortcuts for every action.
- Remove torrents safely: removing from the list and removing together with the files are separate
  commands, and deleting files always asks for explicit confirmation.
- Download sequentially and show how much of each file is already playable from its start.
- Show total speeds, free disk space and connection state in a status bar; toggle alternative speed
  limits and set global download and upload limits.
- Follow the system light or dark theme, and remember the window, columns, sorting and filter
  between runs.
- Stay light on memory and gentle on low-powered servers, as a single native executable.

More is planned after that.

## Requirements

- Transmission 4.1 or newer
- Linux (other platforms are not supported yet)

## Build from source

On Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed just cargo-nextest cargo-deny cargo-machete taplo-cli typos
just setup
just run
```
